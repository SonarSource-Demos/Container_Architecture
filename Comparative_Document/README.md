## ‚úÖ Introduction
Containers have become a crucial solution for deploying and managing modern applications. They offer increased portability and simplified dependency management. The leading cloud providers‚ÄîAzure, AWS, and Google Cloud‚Äîoffer various container solutions. Additionally, OpenShift, a Kubernetes-based platform from Red Hat, provides a comprehensive enterprise solution. This document compares the main options provided by these vendors.

## ‚úÖ Amazon Web Services (AWS) 
AWS offers several services for container management:
